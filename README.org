* About

=Emacs-Build-Farm= is an Emacs interface for [[https://nixos.org/hydra/][Hydra]] and [[https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/guix/guix-cuirass.git/][Cuirass]] â€” build
farms for [[https://nixos.org/nix/][Nix]] and [[https://www.gnu.org/software/guix/][Guix]] package managers, i.e., for:

| https://hydra.nixos.org   | Hydra for Nix    |
| https://hydra.gnu.org     | Hydra for Guix   |
| https://berlin.guixsd.org | Cuirass for Guix |

This package allows you to look at builds, jobsets and projects of these
build farms.

* Usage

The entry point for the available features is `M-x build-farm` command.
It provides a [[https://github.com/magit/magit-popup][magit-popup]] interface to display builds, jobsets and
projects.

Alternatively, you can use the following `M-x` commands directly:

- `build-farm-projects`
- `build-farm-project`
- `build-farm-jobsets`
- `build-farm-latest-builds`
- `build-farm-queued-builds`
- `build-farm-build`

** Keys in "list" buffers

Most of the above commands show "list" buffers (list of builds, etc.).
These lists provide some key bindings, the main of which are:

- `h` (hint): allows you to look at the provided key bindings;
- `RET`: displays "info" buffer for the current entry or several marked
  entries (marked with `m` key).
